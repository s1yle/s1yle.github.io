# 一次特别的尝试：我的首次开源贡献与博客部署



> 点滴进步，都值得记录

> Deepseek helped me to write this



今天是个特别的日子，我完成了两个重要的技术尝试：向 tsoding 的仓库提交了人生中第一个 Pull Request（PR），以及使用 Hexo 成功部署了 GitHub Pages。这不仅是技术上的进步，更是我个人成长路上的重要里程碑。



## 上午：第一次 PR 的激动



今天上午，我怀着忐忑的心情向 tsoding 的仓库提交了我的第一个 PR。这是我首次为别人的开源项目添加新功能，整个过程既有趣又令人兴奋。



虽然目前还没有收到回复，但这种参与开源社区、为他人项目做贡献的感觉真的很特别。从 fork 仓库到本地开发，再到提交 PR，每一步都让我感受到开源协作的魅力。这让我想到，开源贡献并不是高不可攀的，每个人都可以从解决一个小问题或添加一个小功能开始参与。



提交完成后，我不时刷新页面，期待着维护者的回应。这种等待既紧张又兴奋，就像是寄出一封重要的信件，期待对方的回音。



## 晚上：Hexo 与 GitHub Pages 的完美结合



晚上，我将注意力转向了博客部署。使用 Hexo 框架成功部署了 GitHub Pages，这个过程比我想象的要顺利。



看着自己部署的页面能够通过 GitHub Pages 公开访问，这种成就感无以言表。技术让我们能够如此轻松地分享知识和经验，这确实是一个令人振奋的时代。



# 今日收获



今天的两项成就虽然看似简单，但对我而言意义重大：



1. 突破了参与开源项目的心理障碍，意识到每个人都可以为开源社区做贡献

2. 掌握了静态网站部署的基本流程，为以后的技术分享奠定了基础

3. 体验了从代码编写到提交再到部署的完整流程，增强了技术自信心



记录这些不只是为了备忘，更是为了鼓励自己继续在技术道路上探索。正如许多技术博主所说，写博客不仅是分享，更是对知识的梳理和巩固。



期待明天的新的挑战和收获！







# A Special Attempt: My First Open Source Contribution and Blog Deployment



> Every little progress is worth recording

> Deepseek helped me to write this



Today was a special day. I accomplished two significant technical attempts: submitted my first Pull Request (PR) to tsoding's repository, and successfully deployed GitHub Pages using Hexo. This represents not only technical progress but also an important milestone in my personal growth journey.



## Morning: The Excitement of My First PR



This morning, I submitted my first PR to tsoding's repository with a mix of nervousness and excitement. This was my first time adding a new feature to someone else's open source project, and the entire process was both fascinating and thrilling.



Although I haven't received a response yet, the feeling of participating in the open source community and contributing to others' projects is truly special. From forking the repository to local development, and then submitting the PR, each step made me appreciate the charm of open source collaboration. It reminded me that open source contribution isn't an unattainable goal—everyone can start by solving a small problem or adding a small feature.



After submitting, I found myself refreshing the page periodically, anticipating the maintainer's response. This waiting period is both anxious and exciting, similar to sending an important letter and eagerly awaiting a reply.



## Afternoon: The Perfect Combination of Hexo and GitHub Pages



In the afternoon, I turned my attention to blog deployment. I successfully deployed GitHub Pages using the Hexo framework, and the process went smoother than I had expected.



Seeing my deployed page accessible publicly through GitHub Pages brought an indescribable sense of accomplishment. Technology enables us to share knowledge and experiences so effortlessly—this is truly an exciting era to live in.



# Today's Harvest



Although today's two achievements might seem simple, they hold great significance for me:



1. I broke through the psychological barrier of participating in open source projects, realizing that everyone can contribute to the open source community

2. I mastered the basic workflow of static website deployment, laying the foundation for future technical sharing

3. I experienced the complete process from coding to submission and deployment, enhancing my technical confidence



Recording these moments isn't just for keeping memos—it's also about encouraging myself to continue exploring the path of technology. As many technical bloggers say, writing blogs is not only about sharing but also about organizing and consolidating knowledge.



Looking forward to new challenges and harvests tomorrow!
